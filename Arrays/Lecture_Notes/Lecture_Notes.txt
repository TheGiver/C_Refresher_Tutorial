Lecture Title: Arrays
---------------------
Defining arrays:
An array is a specific data structure that can hold multiple values of the 
same type and store them in a contigious block of memory and each data can 
be accessed via an index. 
---------------------
Defining an array:
If you would like to define an array, then follow the following usage guide:
                    <data_type> <var_name>[size];
---------------------
Default content of an array:
* If an array has been declared at the file score (outside any function), or has 
  been declared as 'static', then the default value of the array indices is zero. 

* If an array has been declared in the scope of a function and has not been declared 
  as static, then the default value is essentially garbage values (unexpected and cannot
  predict it).

* If we manually initialise the array, then the content of the array will be whatever values 
  we have used during the initialisation process.
