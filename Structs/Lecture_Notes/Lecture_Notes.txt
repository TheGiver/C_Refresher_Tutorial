Lecture Title: Structs
----------------------
Why structs?
Struct is a data structure in C that allows you to store & group data of multiple
types unlike arrays which can only store data of a specific type. 

This small feature of structs is vital to the creation of complex data structures 
such as linked lists, binary trees, etc. 
----------------------
Declaring structs:
In C, structs are declared in the following manner:
                    struct struct_tag {
                        /* Data */
                    } [one or more struct variables];
We can think of structs in the same way we think of classes in Java and other object
oriented modules. Structs usually represent data that are somehow related to each other. 
----------------------
Typedef:
Typedef is a keyword available in C that allows you to define your own type and use that 
type within the program. 

You can use this keyword when declaring a struct in the following way:
                typedef struct {
                    /* Data */
                } struct_tag;

Then, whenever you would like to initialize a struct you can do so like this:
                    struct_tag variable_name;
----------------------
Accessing struct's data:
In order to access the data of a struct and ammend the value of the different data types
then you will have to make use of the dot (.). All usage can be found online or in the src 
directory created for this lecture.
