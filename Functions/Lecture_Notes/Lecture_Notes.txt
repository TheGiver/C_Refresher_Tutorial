Lecture Title: Functions
------------------------
Characteristics of functions:
Functions can either be declared as void which indicates that they do not return anything. Or, 
they could declared in a way such that they do return a value. But, keep in mind that a function 
can only return one value. 
------------------------
Arguments:
Function arguments in C are pass by value. This suggests that if you do pass arguments to a function, 
then the original value of that arguments will not be affected outside the scope of that function. 

In the scenario where you do want to affect the arguments' original values, then you would have to make 
use of what is known as pointers. 
------------------------
Definition:
In C, you have to define/declare the function before using it. You can write the body of that function later 
on, but the function signature must be declared before usage.
